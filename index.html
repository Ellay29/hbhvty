          <h3>Mikrotik Router Training</h3>
          <p>During my 4th year in college I undergo with one semester of training in Mikrotik routers. With our instructor Engr. Almer Laureta, introduce us the basics of Mikrotik routers, their features, and their applications in different network environments.  Learning how to install and configure the RouterOS operating system on MikroTik routers. Understanding the administrative tasks, such as user management, system backup and restore, and firmware upgrades.Configuring IP addresses, subnetting, and implementing various network address translation (NAT) techniques. Learning about dynamic routing protocols, including OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), and their implementation on MikroTik routers.Understanding firewall concepts and configuring firewall rules to protect the network and control traffic.Configuring QoS mechanisms to prioritize network traffic and ensure optimal performance for critical applications. Setting up secure VPN connections using different protocols, such as IPsec, PPTP, L2TP, and OpenVPN.Configuring wireless interfaces, implementing security measures, and optimizing wireless network performance.Setting up a hotspot for providing controlled public internet access, including user authentication, billing, and session management.  Exploring various tools and techniques for monitoring network traffic, bandwidth utilization, and managing network devices remotely.These are the topics covered in Mikrotik router training. The training program are the specific needs and requirement.From basic configuration to advance routing and network management techniques.</p>

          <h3>Programmable Logic Controller Traning</h3>
          <p>Same with Mikrotik Training I also take a sem in Industrial Control training with our instructor Sir Edwin Gonzales. I learn the fundamental concepts and practical skills required to program and operate PLC systems.  Understanding the basics of PLCs, their history, and their applications in industrial automation.Learning basic programming languages used in PLCs, including ladder logic, function block diagrams (FBD), structured text (ST), and instruction list (IL). Configuring digital and analog inputs and outputs, understanding different signal types, and addressing I/O modules.
